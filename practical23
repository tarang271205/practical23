Program: 23 Imagine you are working on a program that predicts how something grows over 
time, like how much money you might save each month. The growth pattern 
follows a rule similar to the Fibonacci series, where the amount saved each month 
is the sum of the two previous months. To help calculate this, you need a program 
that can generate the Fibonacci series. Take the number of series user want to see 
through keyboard input. 
Code: #include <stdio.h> 
 
// Here This Function Used For Create Fibonacci Series. 
void generateFibonacci(int n) { 
    int a = 0, b = 1, next; 
 
    //Here This Loop Stands For Print And Generate Series.  
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 
        printf("%d ", a); // Print the first term. 
        next = a + b;     // For calculate next term. 
        a = b;            // Update value of 'a' to 'b'.  
        b = next;         // Update 'b' to generate next term. 
    } 
    printf("\n"); //here this Printf used for a new line after the series. 
} 
 
int main() { 
    int num; 
    // taking input from user. 
    printf("Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to see: "); 
    scanf("%d", &num);  
 
 
 
    // Here this conditional statement used for check that number is valid or not(positive 
or not) 
    if (num <= 0) { 
        printf("Please enter a positive integer.\n"); 
    } else { 
        // Call the function after check that number is valid or not   
        generateFibonacci(num); 
    } 
 
   printf("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24ce032_TARANG");
 
    return 0;  
}
